      <h3 class="mt20 mb10">Craghoppers:</h3>

      <p>When Craghoppers came up with the idea in 1965 of turning the passion for travel into an authentic business, the team felt they were making an exciting and sometimes dangerous journey into the unknown. In retrospect, her perseverance has paid off and Craghoppers is now recognized as a global outdoor and adventure travel specialist.</p>

      <p>The world may have evolved over the past 50 years, but its mission today is the same as it was decades ago - to create a comfortable and functional clothing collection. We try to improve every year by introducing new designs using the latest technologies, making our products comfortable, lightweight, waterproof, insulating and UV-protective</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, we are the world leader in outdoor and hiking pants. One of our biggest achievements is NosiLife - a complete, lightweight adventure collection that provides lasting and safe protection against biting insects and their transmitted diseases.</p>

      <p>Today, we are honored to share our wanderlust with millions of people - fellow travelers who are also interested in exploring the remotest areas of our beautiful planet and sharing their experiences with others.</p>
